## Introduction

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The "[ml-latest-small](./ml-latest-small)" dataset presents a comprehensive collection of movie ratings and tags, amassed from a diverse user base. The dataset comprises

- **9,742 movies**, encompassing various genres and time periods.
- **610 users**, who have actively participated in rating movies and tagging content.
- **1,589 unique tags**, indicating the varied preferences and tastes of the user base.
- A substantial number of **ratings**, amounting to **100,836**, which illustrates the extensive engagement of users with the platform.

### Recommendation Techniques
1. **Content-Based Filtering:**
2. **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
3. **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering:**

### Evaluation Method
1. **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):** RMSE quantifies the average predictive error between actual and predicted ratings, with lower values indicating better accuracy.
2. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** MAE calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual ratings, with lower values signifying improved prediction accuracy.
3. **Hit Rate:** Hit Rate measures the proportion of recommended items that match user interactions or preferences.
4. **Coverage:** Coverage assesses the percentage of items in the catalogue that the recommender system can suggest.
5. **Novelty:** Novelty evaluates the uniqueness and diversity of recommendations to introduce users to unfamiliar items.
6. **Recall @k:** Recall @ k quantifies the fraction of relevant items recommended within the top-k list.
7. **Precision@k:** Precision @ k measures the accuracy of relevant items within the top-k recommendations.


## Results

### Root Mean Squared Error (RSME)
**User-based** and **Item-based** have the lowest RMSE, suggesting they are the most accurate in predicting exact ratings. 

**Year-based** and **Weighted year based** have the highest RMSE, implying they might not be as accurate in predicting ratings.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
**User-based** and **item-based** excel, indicating they are adept at accurately predicting ratings. 

**Year-based** has the highest MAE, followed closely by combined content-based.

### Hit Rate
**SVD** has an outstandingly high hit rate, implying itâ€™s most effective at suggesting movies users will interact with. 

**NCF** model an**User-based** have very low hit rates, suggesting users might not find their recommendations as engaging.

### Coverage
Almost all recommenders have a coverage of 1.0000 or near to 1.o. This means they can potentially recommend any movie in the dataset

**NCF model** has an unusually low coverage of 0.0001 or 0.01%. This means it can only recommend a tiny fraction of the available items.      

### Novelty
The **NCF model** stands out with an extraordinarily high novelty score, suggesting it recommends less popular items. 

**SVD** has the lowest novelty, implying it tends to suggest more popular or mainstream movies.

### Precision at K (P@k)
**SVD** dominates, implying that a high proportion of its top recommendations are items users have interacted with. 

The **NCF model** has the lowest precision, suggesting its top recommendations are rarely hits with users.

###  Recall at K (R@k)
**SVD** filtering excels, suggesting it's able to capture most of the items users have interacted with in its top recommendations.

**User-based** and **NCF model** filtering have very low recall, indicating they miss out on many movies users would interact with.
